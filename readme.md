# Client Stack

Client Stack is a full stack Java application that I created as an extra Capstone Project
at the CareerDevs Computer Science Academy.  The application functions as a way for a hair stylist to organize their list of clients along with information about them including; phone number, email, last appointment date, next appointment date, and their services.

### Technologies used in this application are as follows:

* Java 8
* Spring MVC
* Hibernate
* Sql
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* FullCalendar.js
* Moment.js
* Bootstrap
